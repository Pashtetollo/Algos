<h1>Laboratory work 2 (data structures)</h1></br>
One of the data structures should be implemented.</br>
0 - Stack (based on double-linked list)</br>
1 - Queue with priorities</br>
2- Bilateral queue (based on double-linked list)</br>
3- Binary (or Binary) search tree</br>
4 - Hash table</br>
You should perform the operations of inserting, returning an element without deleting, deleting (for example - return and delete the first element from the stack), and search for a specific element (if such an operation is supported by the data structure)</br>
Your option is <h3>Stack</h3>
