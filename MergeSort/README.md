<h1>Laboratory 1</h1></br>
Your task is to implement a <h3>Merge Sort</h3> sorting algorithm. The input data is a one-dimensional array of numbers, which is written through a comma and can be run as follows:</br>
python merge_sort.py asc 1,2,56,45, -9,78,11</br>
java MergeSort.java desc 1,2,56,45, -9,78,11</br>
asc - ascending</br>
desc - descending</br>
That is, your code must be able to sort ascending. and descending</br>
The result should display:</br>
- the name of the algorithm</br>
- work time</br>
- the number of comparison operations that were performed during the operation of the algorithm</br>
- the number of exchange operations that were performed during the operation of the algorithm</br>
- Sorting results</br>

Every student must have their own code!</br>
The code should be filled in Github before the demonstration to the teacher and add a comment link in the document with grades</br>
The project must have correctly configured .gitignore (compilation files, IDE configuration files must be absent in the repository)</br>
Your code should be covered by tests that verify:</br>
- sort the input array</br>
- sort in ascending order of sorted array in ascending order</br>
- sort in descending order of sorted array in ascending order</br>
- sort in descending order of sorted array in ascending order</br>
- sort descending sorted array descending</br>
