### Laboratory work 6 (Dreamers)

Beavers Antin and Ori came up with loads - to invent random binary numbers, and to check whether these numbers can be broken into pieces, the dependencies of which are the power of X in the tens system.

For example, if X == 5, then the binary number 101110011 can be divided into 101, 11001 and 1, each of which is 5 to some degree (101 in decimal == 5 == 5¹, 11001 == 25 == 5² and 1 == 1 is 5⁰).

Demonstrate that humans are smarter than beavers, and for a given binary number N, know the smallest number of pieces to break it into.

####Incoming data:
 - The first line contains X - a sequence of zeros and ones and N.

####Output data:
 - The smallest number of pieces into which we can divide the input number, or -1 if this is not possible.
